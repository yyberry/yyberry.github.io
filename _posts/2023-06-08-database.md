This is a learning note related to relational database. 



## Intro

1. Relational Database & Non-Relational database (e.g. json)
   * Relational Databases use SQL and store data in tables with rows and columns
2. SQL (Structured query language)
3. DBMS (Database Management System)
   * it is a software application that allows users to perform C.R.U.D (Create, Read, Update, Delate) operations and other administrative tasks.



## SQL

1. **Capital or not**

   It is not necessary. But capital cords can help us to distinguish the reserved word with what we have written.

2. **Semicolon**

   All statements need to be end with semicolon ( ; ).

3. **Datatype**

   * **INT: ** whole numbers
   * **DECIMAL(M,N): **decimal numbers. M is the number of total digits; N is the number of decimal digits.
   * **VARCHAR(N): **string. N suggests the number of characters
   * **BLOB: **binary large object, stores large data
   * **DATE: **'YYYY-MM-DD'
   * **TIMESTAMP: **'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'

4. **Create table**

   * **Primary Key: ** two ways to denote the primary key

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE student(
         student_id INT,
         name VARCHAR(20),
         major VARCHAR(20),
         PRIMARY KEY(student_id) 
     );
     ```

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE student(
         student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(20),
         major VARCHAR(20)
     );
     ```

   * **Constraints: ** 

     * NOT NULL (the field cannot be NULL); 
     * UNIQUE (each value in the same attribute should be different); 
     * DEFAULT (set a defsult value); 
     * AUTO_INCREMENT (increase the number automatically)

     ```	sql
     CREATE TABLE student(
         student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
         name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
         major VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
       	gpa DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
         PRIMARY KEY(student_id) 
     );
     ```

   * **FOREIGN KEY: **

     * **ON DELETE SET ** NULL: when the foreign key is deleted, the related field will be set to null

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE branch (
       branch_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       branch_name VARCHAR(40),
       mgr_id INT,
       mgr_start_date DATE,
       FOREIGN KEY(mgr_id) REFERENCES employee(emp_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
     );
     ```

     * **ON DELETE CASCADE**: when the foreign key is deleted, the whole row will be deleted

5. **Describe table **

   ```sql
   DESCRIBE student;
   ```

6. **Delete table**

   ```sql
   DROP TABLE student;
   ```

7. **Modify table**

   * **Add column in table**

     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE student ADD gpa DECIMAL(3,2);
     ```

   * **Drop column in table**

     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN gpa;
     ```

8. **Insert information in table**

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO student VALUES(1, 'Jack', 'Biology');  	-- with all things
   INSERT INTO student(student_id, major) VALUES(3, 'Computer Science'); -- no name
   INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(4, 'Claire'); -- no major
   ```

9. **Update information in table**

   * **Comparision operations**
     * $=$ (equals)
     * $<>$ (not equals)
     * $>$; $>=$
     * $<$; $<=$
   * **Where** is optional.

   ```sql
   UPDATE student 
   SET name = 'Someone', major = 'Biochemistry'
   WHERE major = 'Biology' OR major = 'Chemistry';
   ```

10. **Delete information in table **

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM student
    WHERE name = 'Someone' AND student_id = 1;
    ```

11. **Query information from table**

    * **DESC: ** set to descending order, default is ascending order .
    * **ASC: ** set to ascenging order
    * In SQL, the **correct order** of the clauses should be: **SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY**, and **LIMIT**. 
    * **AS:** rename
    * **DISTINCT: **return distinct values

    ```sql
    SELECT student_id AS id, name, major 
    FROM student
    WHERE student_id <> 1 AND name IN ('Maria', 'Jack')
    ORDER BY major, student_id DESC
    LIMIT 2; -- limite the number of rows returned, in this case, we can only get 2 rows back
    ```

12. **Functions**

    * **COUNT: ** count the number of subjects
    * **AVG: **compute average value
    * **SUM: ** compute the sum
    * **GROUP BY: **groups rows that have the same values into summary rows

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(emp_id), AVG(salary), SUM(salary)
    FROM employee;
    
    SELECT COUNT(sex), sex
    GROUP BY sex;
    ```

13. **Widdcards**

    * **%:** represents zero or more characters
    * **_:** represents a single character
    * **[any_characters]:** represents any single character within the brackets
    * **\[^any_characters\]:** epresents any character not in the brackets
    * **\[character1-character2\]:** represents any single character within the specified range

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM client
    WHERE client_name LIKE '%LLC'
    ```

14. **Unions**

    * Every **SELECT** statement within **UNION** must have the **same number of columns**
    * The columns must also have **same data types**
    * The columns in every **SELECT** statement must also be in the same order

    ```sql
    SELECT client_name, client.branch_id
    FROM client
    UNION
    SELECT supplier_name, branch_supplier.branch_id
    FROM branch_supplier
    ```

15. **Joins**

    * **JOIN:** combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

    ```sql
    SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
    FROM employee
    JOIN branch
    ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;
    ```

    * **INNER JOIN: ** same with **JOIN**
    * **LEFT JOIN: **returns all records from the left table (employee), and the matching records from the right table (branch).
    * **RIGHT JOIN: **do the opposite from **LEFT JOIN**
    * **FULL (OUTER) JOIN: **combined **LEFT JOIN** and **RIGHT JOIN**

16. **Triggers**

    One useful way to keep track of the actions in database, see the vedio [triggers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=12605s) for details

    

## Difinations

1. **Surrogate key** 

   a type of primary key, doesn't mean anything in the real world, just a key assigned to a value

2. **Natural key**

   a type of primary key, but has a mapping in the real world not just in the database.

3. **Foreign key**

   stores the primary key of a row in another database table, help defines the relationships between different tables.

4. **Composite key**

   refers to two or more columns that act as primary key
