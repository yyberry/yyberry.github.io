This is a learning note related to the Jacobian matrix and Hessian matrix.



1. Jacobian matrix 

   Assume $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ is a function that takes a point $\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ as input and produces the vector $f(\boldsymbol{x})\in\mathbb{R}^m$. The function  consists of $m$ real functions: 

   
   $$
   \nonumber f = [f_1(x_1,...,x_n),\cdot\cdot\cdot, f_m(x_1,...,x_n)]
   $$
   

   The partial derivatives of these functions (if they exist) can form a  $m×n$ matrix called **Jacobian matrix**.  It can be denoted as $\boldsymbol{J}$.

2. Hessian matrix

   Hessian matrix consists of second-order partial derivatives. 

   Assume $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a function that takes a point $\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ as input and produces a scalar $f(\boldsymbol{x})\in\mathbb{R}$. The **Hessian matrix** $\boldsymbol{H}$ of $f$ is a square $n×n$ matrix, usually defined as:

3. Summary

   * If $f(\boldsymbol{x})$ is a **scalar function**, then the **Jacobian matrix is a vector**, equal to the gradient of $f(\boldsymbol{x})$, and the **Hessian matrix is a two-dimensional matrix**. While $f(\boldsymbol{x})$  is a **vector function**, then the **Jacobian matrix is a two-dimensional matrix** and the **Hessian matrix is a three-dimensional matrix**.
   * The gradient is a special case of the Jacobian matrix, and the jacobian matrix of the gradient is the Hessian matrix (the relationship between the first-order partial derivative and the second-order partial derivative)
